About
============================

This is the Python version of ["Introduction to Econometrics with R"](https://www.econometrics-with-r.org/) by Christoph Hanck, Martin Arnold, Alexander Gerber, and Martin Schmelzer. Many thanks to the authors. 

I exactly map the structure of the book and only provide the corresponding Python code with minimal instructions if ever needed. Please refer to the original book for the content.

To run the code via the virtual environment, you can clone this [book's repo](https://github.com/harrywang/econometrics-with-python), switch to the root of the repo folder, and do the following:

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r econometrics-with-python/requirements.txt 
```
then you can open the notebooks by running `jupyter notebook` or you can open [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) by running `code .` and open the notebooks inside VSCode using the virtual environment created above.
